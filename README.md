# RPG-Characters

This is not a game, but a modelling and class design exercise study, learning design patterns and SOLID principles.
Taught me a lot about inheritance, composition and polymorphism in the OOP domain.

## Features

### Heroes

3 types of heroes:

1. Warrior
2. Ranger
3. Mage 
Designed to make it easily extendable.

### Items

3 types of Armor and 3 types of weapons. Armor fits in certain slots of the Hero.
Also designed with extendability in mind.
